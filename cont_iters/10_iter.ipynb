    "As requested, the wait times are now always positive. The patient arrivals are now generated inside the StrokeWard class, meaning the number of functions has been reduced as there is now not a separate arrival process for different patient types. The LLM did not include an option to run the model inside this class as instructed. However, the LLM has changed the interarrival time for all patients to have a mean of 1.2, which is the IAT for Stroke type patients only, calling this a 'Default interarrival time' (interarrival_time = rng.exponential(1.2))."
