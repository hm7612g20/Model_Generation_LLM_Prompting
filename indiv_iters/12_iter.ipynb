    "The LLM successfully implemented the summary function inside the class, which outputs the same results as iteration 11, as well as additional information about the mean number of patients in the queue during the model run time. The number of patients waiting in the queue increased if the length of stay for some patient types increased or the number of beds decreased, as was expected. The LLM was only provided with the code for the StrokeWard class in this case and was successful in implementing the change from this. As with iteration 11, the exit point for the patients changes each time the code is run as it is being sampled using a random choice."
