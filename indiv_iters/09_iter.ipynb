One missed bracket had to be inserted that was missed by the LLM. The Scenario class holds the constants and set up the default parameters but it did not initialise distributions correctly as there is no option to sample from the distributions. It only calculated the mu and sigma for the Lognormal distribution inside this class. It also initialised a single random seed inside the class, with no option to change this."
