    "The LLM has created a function inside the Scenario class that changes the random seeds based on the number of iterations as instructed, and now the output is different for each multiple replication. A Scenario class object is being passed to the multiple replications function, but is only being used to sample the number of beds used, when this could be passed to the function itself. The new method inside the Scenario class enables different random seeds to be generated that add 1 to the seed each time, as shown in the test above. Patients are still holding their bed until they leave and their length of stay is being sampled from distributions. As the run length is being set up inside the function, it cannot be changed unless the function itself is altered."
