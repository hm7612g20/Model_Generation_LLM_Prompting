    "The patients are now holding the beds for their length of stay before being discharged to one of the three locations, which is being randomly assigned based on probabilities. The same mean waiting times and lengths of stay are output as iteration 9 so the bug from iteration 10 has been fixed. However, as it is using a random choice, the location where patients go after they leave the stroke ward is not fixed so outputs a different exit point each time the code is run."
