# Generating Model using LLM Prompting

> Developed as part of MSc Health Data Science (University of Exeter) programme.

This technical appendix presents the code generated by PerplexityAI (1) in an attempt to create a published simulation model (2) and subsequent manual adaptations. Please use the conda environment provided in environment.yml to run the model.

The final_model presented was adapted from the AI-generated code given in the indiv_iters folder. For information on how the code has been adapted, see the _MODIFICATIONS Notebooks in this folder. Indiv_iters refers to generating code using separate threads in PerplexityAI, whereas cont_iters refers to using the same thread to generate the model. In both cases, the model has been adapated iteratively by adding improvements and complexity at each stage.
