    "The LLM has changed the StrokeWard class to initialise the simpy.Environment() as instructed so the multiple replications function now runs. However, each run gives the same results as the same random seed is being used each time. Each output is the same as the single_run function output. As the model output is printed each time, these have been commented out. It has also forgotten the Scenario class it previously created so has created a new one."
